### Proposition and judgements 

[Martin-Löf’83](https://www.hf.uio.no/ifikk/english/research/publications/journals/njpl/files/vol1no1/meaning.pdf)

We must distinguish **propositions** and **judgements** :
 - Propositions are assertions, affirmation, about something, that might be true, or not. A proposition can exist in an undetermined state. 
 - Judgement are *acts of knowing*

The proposition is the content, or *truth content* of an expression, of a statement. A judgement is the act of affirming that statement, as true or false.
